## About

Hi, I'm **Aksel**, an AI research student and deep learning developer from **Armenia**, focused on understanding and building intelligent systems grounded in strong mathematical and engineering foundations.

I am particularly interested in **deep learning** and **large language models**, and in learning how advanced AI systems are trained, optimized, and deployed efficiently.

**Top skills:** Python · Artificial Intelligence · Machine Learning · Deep Learning · Data Science

---

## AI & Machine Learning — Learning Path (In Progress)

- Python for AI development, automation, and APIs  
- Advanced Python programming for AI systems  
- Data & scientific stack: **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy**, Jupyter  
- Deep learning with **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**  
- Large Language Models (LLMs): **LLaMA, OpenAI API, LangChain**  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
- Vector databases: **Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate**  
- Prompt engineering and intelligent agent design  
- Core ML: **scikit-learn**, regression, classification, k-NN, SVM, decision trees, ensemble methods, gradient boosting  
- Neural networks: **CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs**, generative models (GANs)  
- Fundamentals of **NLP** and **computer vision**  
- Data science: EDA, pipelines, model evaluation and optimization  
- GPU acceleration: **CUDA, Triton, TensorRT** (exploration)  

> My focus is on understanding **how and why** models work, not only using high-level tools.
