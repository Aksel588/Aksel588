## Aksel Aghajanyan  
**AI Research Student | Deep Learning Developer | Backend Engineer**

I’m **Aksel**, an AI research student and backend developer from **Armenia**, focused on understanding and building intelligent systems with strong foundations in **mathematics, machine learning, and software engineering**.

I have hands-on experience developing scalable backend applications using **Python, PHP (Laravel), and MySQL**, and I actively explore how modern AI techniques can be applied in real-world systems. My interests lie at the intersection of **AI research, intelligent agents, automation, and system-level design**.

## AI & Machine Learning (Learning Path)

- Python for AI development, scripting, and automation  
- Deep learning with **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**  
- Large Language Models (LLMs): **LLaMA, OpenAI API, LangChain**  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
- Vector databases: **Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate**  
- Prompt engineering and AI agent design  
- Core ML concepts: regression, classification, k-NN, SVM  
- Decision trees, ensemble methods, gradient boosting  
- Neural networks: **CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs**, generative models (GANs)  
- Fundamentals of **NLP** and **computer vision**  
- Data science basics: EDA, pipelines, model evaluation  

> Focused on understanding how models work internally, not only using high-level APIs.
