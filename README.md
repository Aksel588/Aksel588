### About Me

I started my programming journey at the age of 14, and ever since, technology has been my true passion. Currently, I'm studying at an information college in Armenia, where I continue to enhance my skills and knowledge in the world of programming.

From developing a shop application using PHP as my first project to creating projects in Python, C++, and JavaScript, I have gained hands-on experience in different programming paradigms and technologies. 

Currently, I am working on a comprehensive web application using Laravel 11. This application, designed for educational purposes, allows teachers to create programming tests for students, with features like result tracking, test customization, and an intuitive user interface.

In this fast-paced industry, it is essential to continuously learn and adopt the latest technologies. I am currently studying Unreal Engine and C++ to expand my expertise in game development and AI. My ultimate goal is to build immersive and intelligent applications that push the boundaries of innovation and creativity.

#### Communication Skills
I have the ability to effectively convey ideas, technical concepts, and project updates to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Clear communication is vital for collaboration and project success.

#### Problem-Solving
One of my strengths is my ability to analyze challenges and find innovative solutions. I thrive on problem-solving, especially when faced with unexpected obstacles during development.

#### Time Management
As a multitasker, I have developed excellent time management skills. I prioritize tasks effectively, meet deadlines, and manage time efficiently, ensuring that projects are delivered on time.

#### Teamwork & Collaboration
I have valuable experience working with cross-functional teams and collaborating with various stakeholders. I believe that united efforts lead to better outcomes, and I actively contribute to creating a positive team environment.
